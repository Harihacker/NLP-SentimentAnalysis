# Model Train:
    1. Design sample scale module to make sure the sample is available for linear or svm training.
    2. Integrate training module.
    3. Add parameter setting module, like SVM/Logistic Regression and parameters selection,
       and this module should be flexiable as far as possible, need more test on different
       samples.

# Predict with trained model:
    1. Add parameter setting module, in current the model use the default settings.
    2. Design other probability computation model.

# Whole System:
    1. Optimizate the whole system remove some unnecessary processing.

# Further Works:
    1. Try to use these models on multi-classification.
